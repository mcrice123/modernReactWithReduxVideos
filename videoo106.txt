Modals in React and Redux

modal: a window that pops up to the user (to get user's attention)

difficult to build in React

3-step process:

One source of problems with modals: z-index styling. Modal needs to be on top of everything else! Becomes a problem when modal is child component at bottom of tree.

Another source of problems: if modal's parent is the body and the child component tries to access Provider tag inside a different hierarchy rooted in the body, it can't. 

Have provider as child of modal/parent of child component as well as provider for different hierarchy.
