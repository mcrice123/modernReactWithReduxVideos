Right now, state is static. The activebook should be able to change (be dynamic). 

Have to use action creator...

Diagram of the life cycle of an action in Redux. 
1. Triggered by an event. Event can optionally call Action Creator, a function that returns an object or action. 
2. Action Creator returns object or action.
3. Action is automatically sent to all reducers. 
4. Property on state is set to value returned from the corresponding reducer.
5. All reducers process action and return new state. Containers are notified about change and re-render with new props.
