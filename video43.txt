A little review about Redux:

First start out with a reducer function which returns an object (in this case, it was an array of books). 

Add this reducer function to the combineReducers function in index.js of the reducers folder. The reducer adds a key to the global app state and its value is what is returned from the reducer (the object). 

Promote a component to container by adding import statement for {connect} from react-redux and define mapStateToProps function. Then export connect function, so that it hooks together the mapStateToProps function and the BookList component. 

When that component/container is used, it shows what it returns using the above process.
