All about how to play a selected video--that is, how to have a video option that's clicked on show up in video detail component. Basically passed down a function the sets the state so that selected video is changed when something happens and video list item component indicates that if the li is clicked on, then that function is run. Video detail always shows that selected video, so when selected video changes, it shows the new selected video.
