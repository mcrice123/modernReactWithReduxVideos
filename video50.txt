REVIEW:

Most important: Redux is in charge of state and state is an object. 

App state != component state. 

App state is formed by reducers, which are tied together by combineReducers. Whatever each reducer returns is represented by a key in this combineReducers. 

Actions must have type and payload. 

Done with Section 4!
