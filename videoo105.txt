4 most common errors in React/Redux:
	1. Failing to export results in error message: "React.createElement: type should not be null, undefined, boolean, or number..." CHECK YOUR EXPORT STATEMENTS.
	2. Failing to import correctly (pay attention to curly braces), particularly in reducers, results in nothing showing up and no error messages. CHECK TO SEE IF IMPORTS ARE UNDEFINED--POSSIBLY CAUSED BY INCORRECT IMPORT STATEMENTS. 
	3. Error occurs in promise ("Uncaught (in promise) TypeError:..."). CHECK PROMISES.
	4. Trying to render objects ("Uncaught (in promise) Error: Objects are not valid as React child..."). REACT CANNOT RENDER OBJECTS.
